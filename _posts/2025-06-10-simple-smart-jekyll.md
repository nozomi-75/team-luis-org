The website building landscape has exploded in recent years, with a dizzying array of options vying for your attention. Website builders like WordPress and Wix have made it easier than ever to get online, but in a sea of *drag, drop, and prompt* interfaces, Jekyll still stands out as a refreshing alternative. Or does it? Is it still worth considering in a world where website creation has become increasingly streamlined?

## What is Jekyll

Jekyll is a free, open-source static site generator (SSG) created in Ruby by GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner.[^1] It's in good company with other popular SSGs like Hugo, Gatsby, Middleman, and Hexo. Many even credit it with sparking the trend towards static websites in the 2010s.[^2]

Essentially, these SSGs are software engines that take text-based input and churn out web pages. The "static" part is key: the web pages they generate don't change based on who's looking at them or what they prefer. This is a big difference from dynamic websites, which serve up customized content.

## Why use Jekyll

The primary use case for Jekyll boils down to some seriously compelling upsides. When web pages are pre-built and essentially frozen in time, you get blazing-fast speed and incredible performance. Think about it: when someone clicks on a static page, the server doesn't have to scramble to pull data from a database or run complex scripts. It just hands over the ready-made HTML file, plain and simple. This means lightning-quick load times, which, let's be honest, is a huge win for anyone browsing your site and a big plus for where you rank on search engines.

What's more, Jekyll is "blog-aware" right out of the box. This means it inherently understands common blog structures like posts, categories, tags, and permalinks, making it incredibly intuitive to set up and manage content for a blog without wrestling with complex database configurations or a heavy content management system. You just write your posts in Markdown, and Jekyll handles the rest, generating all the necessary HTML files for your blog archive, individual post pages, and more.[^3]

And of course, because static sites are so predictable and light on server resources, they're incredibly cost-effective to host. You can often host them for free on platforms like GitHub Pages, or for a tiny fraction of the cost on regular web servers.[^4] So, if you're looking for a simple web solution where budget and efficiency are top priorities, Jekyll definitely hits that mark.

## Jekyll in Today's Web

Now, with all those advantages, you might be thinking, "Why isn't evryone using Jekyll?" The truth is, the web landscape has truly exploded since then, especially now with the rise of those "drag, drop, and prompt" website builders. This is where we hit the trade-offs.

Compared to clicking and dragging, Jekyll definitely still has a learning curve. You'll need to be comfortable with the command line, writing in Markdown, and understanding basic templating logic (Jekyll uses something called Liquid). For someone who just wants to get a simple site online yesterday without touching any code, a tool like Wix or WordPress will feel far more intuitive.

There's also the dynamic content question. Remember how we said static pages don't change based on user requests? That's Jekyll's core strength, but also its primary limitation. If your website needs features like user comments, a robust search function, personalized content, or e-commerce capabilities, Jekyll can't do that by itself out-of-the-box. You'd have to integrate third-party services for those features – think Disqus for comments, or a service like Formspree for contact forms.[^5] [^6] This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it means managing multiple platforms rather than one integrated system. It's ultimately up to you whether you want that control and management on your workflow.

And while Jekyll is fantastic for many projects, scaling for extremely large or frequently updated sites can be quite the chore. Building a massive site with thousands of pages can take a significant amount of time, and if content is changing pretty often, rebuilding the entire site constantly might not be the most efficient workflow. If that's your thing though, Hugo might be for you (which we'll address sometime in another post).

## Still Relevant?

So, in a web landscape now dominated by those sleek drag-and-drop website builders and powerful CMSs – which often boast faster build times for massive sites or more integrated dynamic capabilities – does Jekyll still hold its own? Absolutely, but its value proposition has become more defined.

Jekyll isn't trying to be the jack-of-all-trades. Instead, its enduring appeal lies in its stability, simplicity, and rock-solid fundamentals. It doesn't rely on the constantly shifting sands of front-end frameworks, which gives you a predictable environment that remains reliable year after year. For projects that require control and a straightforward content workflow – like personal blogs, project documentation, or informational business sites – Jekyll remains an incredibly strong contender. The mere fact that it continues to be the engine behind GitHub Pages is also a substantial vote of confidence in its favor.

Is it still worth considering? The answer, as with so much in the web world, isn't a simple yes or no. It truly hinges on your specific needs, your comfort level with code, and the nature of your project. If you who appreciate control, values the elegance of Markdown, and prioritizes a simple static site, then Jekyll is not just worth considering – it's often the ideal choice. It might not be the flashiest new tool on the block, but its foundational strengths ensure it's far from irrelevant.
